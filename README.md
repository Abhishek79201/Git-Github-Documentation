### Basics of Cherry-pick

- Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
- In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch.
- **You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.**
- Cherry-pick is a useful tool, but always it is not a good option. It can cause duplicate commits and some other scenarios where other merges are preferred instead of cherry-picking.
- It is a useful tool for a few situations. It is in contrast with different ways such as **merge** and **rebase** command.
- **Use**
    - Scenerio1: Accidently make a commit in a wrong branch.
    - Scenario2: Made the changes proposes by another team member.
- Like we are in branch dev and make some changes and then commit. But If we want this commit in fea branch, So used `git cherry-pick <commit-id>`
